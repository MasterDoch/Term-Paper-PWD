Responsive Design:

Ensure that the website layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) for optimal user experience.

Additionally, you can provide a detailed description and high-quality images of each product, as well as customer reviews to build trust with your audience. Good luck with your Practicum Web Design!
